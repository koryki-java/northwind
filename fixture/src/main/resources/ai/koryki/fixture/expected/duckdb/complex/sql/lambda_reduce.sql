-- list_reduce combines a list into one value: (a, b) is the result so far and the next element,
-- starting with the first element. A list of one element is that element; DuckDB refuses an empty
-- list, so the row that has one is filtered out. A NULL anywhere makes the result NULL, as the sum
-- of a NULL does.
